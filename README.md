This work was performed at TII, in this repository you will find the sources and the dataset that have been used for the diffrent experiments.
This research aims at detecting the DNS-tunneling activities in the IoT context. The following repository inclused the used dataset that we collected from our experiments lab setup. We used a custum approach that mutates the capture files to generate new scenarios.
